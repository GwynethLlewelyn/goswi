Sorry, just the latest one; I have no time to provide fixes for everything!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send me a message, preferably over encrypted mail, to [gwyneth.llewelyn@gwynethllewelyn.net](mailto:gwyneth.llewelyn@gwynethllewelyn.net); you can get my PGP key from https://keybase.io/gwynethllewelyn (where you can also find other forms of contacting me).

On a hurry, the _fastest_ and _most secure way_ to get in touch with me is, of course, through that very same Keybase account, where I'm _always_ logged in (as opposed to other forms of communication). But encrypted email is also fine.
