# goRemoteAdmin
## A very basic command-line tool to connect via XML-RPC to the remote admin console of OpenSimulator

It's still a work in progress.

Loosely based on Marcel Edward's [OpenSim-RemoteAdmin](https://github.com/MarcelEdward/OpenSim-RemoteAdmin/) package, written in PHP (which I can read, unlike so many others), and having this cool idea of using a [RemoteAdmin.json](./RemoteAdmin.json) file to store all possible Remote Admin commands!

This is a standalone CLI tool just to do some basic testing.
